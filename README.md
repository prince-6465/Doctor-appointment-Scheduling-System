# Doctor-appointment-Scheduling-System
The Doctor Appointment Scheduling System is a C-based program that lets users schedule, view, and cancel appointments. It stores data in a file (`appointments.txt`) for persistence. Each record includes ID, patient, doctor, date, and time. With a simple menu and file handling, it efficiently manages clinic appointments.
